Are you a visionary ready to make a maximum impact with minimal resources? We are looking for a CEO to build an innovative software company that serves as the 
foundation for a larger vision: the creation of a foundation that enables a sustainable and affordable lifestyle.  

Since the foundation will be established in Switzerland, it makes sense to set up CrowdWare there as well, as the tax rates align.

**About Us:**  
Our goal is to generate financial resources for a foundation through our software company, CrowdWare. The foundation has a clear vision:  
â€¢ Acquiring land for the development of sustainable communities â€“ featuring yurts, teepees, tiny houses, open kitchens, compost toilets, and other affordable living forms.  
â€¢ People will live there for free or at minimal costs, sustaining themselves with homegrown food, without being subject to the traditional job market.  
â€¢ The foundation also enables:  
â€¢ Land ownership via donations, where donors receive a usufruct right to protect the land from seizures.  
â€¢ Land leases for associations (e.g., for 99 years), which will be self-financed through workshops, food sales, or other activities.  

The foundation for this vision is our first product, Freebook, which has already been released and offers innovative features:  
â€¢ **Interactive Content:** Books in the FreeBookReader can trigger button and image clicks to load pages or open URLs.  
â€¢ **Multimedia Integration:** Videos, YouTube content, and 3D animations can be embedded, including user-controlled camera manipulation (zoom, rotation).  
â€¢ **Markdown &amp; SML (Simple Markup Language):** Content is based on Markdown and created using SML (a QML-like language).  
â€¢ **Cross-Platform Support:** Books are rendered via an Android app using Jetpack Compose. A desktop app (Kotlin Multiplatform) with mobile preview enables the 
  creation and editing of these books.  
â€¢ **EPUB3 Export:** Additionally, EPUB3-compatible eBooks can be generated.  

ðŸ‘‰ Check out the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://freebook.crowdware.at/index.html&quot;&gt;product&lt;/a&gt;  

**Your Mission:**  
â€¢ **License Sales:** Develop sales strategies and actively market Freebook. Your compensation is directly tied to the revenue generated.  
â€¢ **Building a Developer Team:** Recruit talented developers to continue the productâ€™s evolution.  
â€¢ **Fundraising for the Foundation:** Bring the vision of sustainable communities to life by building a successful company.  
â€¢ **Entrepreneurial Leadership:** Take responsibility for scaling the company, using creative approaches to gain market share.  
â€¢ **Collaboration with the Founder:** While I will focus on training new developers, you will concentrate on sales and management.  

**What You Should Bring:**    
â€¢ **Technical Affinity:** An understanding of modern software technologies (like Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, KMP, QML, or Markdown) is a plus.  
â€¢ **Entrepreneurship:** Experience in building businesses or implementing business ideas.  
â€¢ **Sales Mindset:** Strong communication, persuasion skills, and a good sense for sales strategies.  
â€¢ **Network:** Connections in the tech and software industry are a plus.  
â€¢ **Passion for Change:** You are not just interested in building a company, but in working toward a greater vision.  

**What We Offer:**  
â€¢ **Innovative Product:** Freebook offers great potential with impressive features.  
â€¢ **Freedom and Flexibility:** You can build the company according to your vision.  
â€¢ **High Responsibility:** Your performance directly impacts the companyâ€™s success and the realization of the foundation.  
â€¢ **Visionary Project:** The opportunity to build a company and foundation that provides people with an alternative lifestyle.
