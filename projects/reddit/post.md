The **FlatSiteBuilder** is a very easy to use content management system (CMS) and content creation tool running as a desktop application on Linux and Windows. You are able to build web content which you can host on *github pages* for free or any other web space provider. Because all of the pages are being build on the desktop it is the fastest content management system available. No code is executed on the web server.
