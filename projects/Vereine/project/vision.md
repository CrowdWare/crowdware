# Vision

The idea is to create a plattform on the internet where users are able to found an association in Austria without the need to travel to Austria.  

The users do not need to have an address in Austria at all.  

The users can benefit from all the laws in Austria as there are:
- Only 2 people are needed to create an association. One of these will be the association behind the plattform.
- Up to 1 million EUR a year there is no need for bilances or double accounting.  
- We can spend all the profit at the end of the year to avoid paying taxes.  
- Depending on the goal of the association the user does not need to pay himherselves a salary. The user is able to pay everything with the assocation like a car, a mobile phone, a computer, travels etc.
