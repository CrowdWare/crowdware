# Decentral Property
The idea is to find X people to create an association and buy land with this association.

## Example
We are going to buy a plot of land with 5.000 sm for the price of 5.000,- €.
We are going to find 50 people each giving 100,- € to form an association and to buy the land.
Because of the fact that everyone in this association is the owner of this land, it will be difficult for the government or other people to get the land.  

A few of those people might live on this land in mobile homes, so that it's legal to live there.

Those people will grow food, havest water from watertowers that collect water out of the air, or they collect water from a well, river, lake and the like.

Everyone of this association has the right to live there on a plot of 100 sm (10m x 10m).

## Association
We are going to build a process to be able to easily create an association on the internet with just a mouseclick.

Maybe we are creating a website analogous to kickstarter (crowdfunding), where the people can find each other.
Some of them may want to live there right now and other just wanne help with donations.

## Future
Imagine what could be possible if we are going to free our planet using this strategy. We are going to buy our planet back.

Just imagine that one day we people own a region like Schleswig-Holstein. In this case we can make our own rules and laws and are not bound to BRD in this example.  
Pure freedom.
